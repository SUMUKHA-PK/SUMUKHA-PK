Hey there.
I'm Sumukha, currently a software engineer in Walmart Global Tech, Bangalore. I love working with distributed systems and implementing new services, mostly in Go - as you can see from my pinned repositories :P  
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always looking to do something new and collaborate with people and increase my knowledge in what I'm interested in.  
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a **distributed database - xdb** and a **distributed lock service - LocKey**, find both in the organisations I'm part of.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to write beautiful systems in Go and scale them well.  
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything that'd provoke a thought in me :D
